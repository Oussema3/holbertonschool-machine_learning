    Method to perform the forward algorithm for a hidden markov model.
    Parameters:
        Observation (numpy.ndarray of shape (T,)):
         contains the index of the observation
         - T is the number of observations
        Emission (numpy.ndarray of shape (N, M)):
         containing the emission probability of a specific observation given
         a hidden state
            - Emission[i, j] is the probability of observing j given the hidden
            state i
             - N: the number of hidden states.
             - M: the number of all possible observations.
        Transition (2D numpy.ndarray of shape (N, N)):
         containing the transition probabilities
            - Transition[i, j] is the probability of transitioning from the
            hidden state i to j
        Initial (numpy.ndarray of shape (N, 1)):
         containing the probability of starting in a particular hidden state.
    Returns: P, F, or None, None on failure
        P: the likelihood of the observations given the model
        F (numpy.ndarray of shape (N, T)): containing the forward path
         probabilities
            - F[i, j] is the probability of being in hidden state i at time j
            given the previous observations.
